                      Our robot was still undergoing fundamental changes, so we
                      did not perform well, but we finalized our design.</p1

                      We performed well during the qualifier games, earning a
                      spot as an alliance captain during the tournament games.
                      Unfortunately, we were paired against a formidable
                      opponent, so we did not win the tournament. However, we
                      still advanced from our high placement.</p1

                      With an even better bot, we were trying to make a deep run
                      during the State Championship. We didn’t perform as well
                      during the qualifier matches this tournament, and thus we
                      were not picked. We return this season trying go even
                      farther than last year.

                    Our bot incorporates multiple unique features to score
                    points quickly and efficiently. For example, we utilize a
                    simple, compact flywheel design powered by a 6,000 RPM motor
                    to precisely land our drone in the landing zone. We also
                    have an intake system which leads to a custom-created box to
                    contain pixels and drop them at the optimal time. Finally,
                    we use a carefully engineered arm to support our robot’s
                    entire weight on a thin bar.
